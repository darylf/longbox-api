# Longbox API

This is the Ruby/Sinatra implementation of a JSON REST API to power my comic book collection tracker. 

To run the tests, runy `bundle exec rspec` from the command line

To run the app, execute `bundle install` from the command line, folowed by `bundle exec rackup -p 8000`

:boom: This code is still under development, and shouldn't be considered production ready. It is simply an experiment and example app I have coded from scratch. :boom:
